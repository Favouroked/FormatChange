# FormatChange
This file changes the format of a file in a specific directory
For example, if you have a music file 'favour.opus', you can use it to change it to 'favour.mp3'
You have to pass the directory you want the file to act as a system argument to the python file when you want to run it.
For example:
python formatchange.py /home/favour/Music




Thanks
